# BIRTH AND DEATH REGISTRY AUTOMATION SYSTEM

Software Engineering Semester Project: Birth and Death Registration Automation System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vital human information is now an important commodity in the world and sells very much. For such reason this information should be made available. A nation spends so much on population census because of lack of a complete computerized registration system. Also, applicants spend so much time and resources on registration and obtaining of certificate. With the advent of Information Communication Technology (ICT), a nation can make very good use of its resource by investing in such a system. Therefore, the BiRDS software system is being proposed.
The Birth and Death Registry Automation System (BiRDS) is a web-based system that seeks to eliminate the challenges the department currently faces in the registration of births and deaths occurring, as well as in the issuance of these certificates.
